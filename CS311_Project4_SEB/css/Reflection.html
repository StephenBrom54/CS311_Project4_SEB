      <h1>Reflection Page</h1>
      <h5>The most significant challenge I faced while creating the web pages was during the initial setup. I attempted to utilize a template from one of the provided sources, but encountered difficulties in making it work offline. The website suggested referencing another webpage, which seemed to resolve the issue. However, the process was not as straightforward as I had hoped, and it took considerable effort to navigate this hurdle. Despite these challenges, I remained committed to successfully completing the project. Indeed, HTML can initially seem more complex than one might anticipate. It’s not always straightforward, especially when it comes to positioning elements on the page. However, the process of learning the intricacies of HTML can be quite rewarding. It’s fascinating to discover how various elements interact and how you can manipulate them to achieve the desired layout. This project has certainly provided a valuable opportunity to delve deeper into these aspects.
