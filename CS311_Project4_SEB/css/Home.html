      <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Georges Bizet, a French composer, is best known for his opera Carmen, which influenced the verismo school of opera. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, a prolific composer of the classical period, began composing at an early age and produced over 600 works. Giacomo Puccini, an Italian composer primarily known for his operas, is considered the greatest and most successful proponent of Italian opera after Verdi. Giuseppe Verdi, a leading Italian composer of the 19th century, is noted for his operas such as Rigoletto, Il trovatore, La traviata, and others. Richard Wagner, a German composer, revolutionized opera through his concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk, by which he sought to synthesize the poetic, visual, musical, and dramatic arts. Each of these composers made significant contributions to the world of music and their works continue to be celebrated today. </p>
